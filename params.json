{"name":"Lambda Behave","tagline":"A modern testing and behavioural specification framework for Java 8","body":"### Introduction\r\n\r\nIf you're a Java developer and you've seen the fluent, modern specification frameworks available in other programming languages such as spock or jasmine then Lambda Behave is for you. Its goal is to make testing a more pleasant experience than it currently is with junit.\r\n\r\n### Fluent Specifications\r\n\r\nThe Lambda Behave Specification design has several goals in mind:\r\n\r\n* To read like plain English.\r\n* To encourage describing tests using long and descriptive sentences, rather than a few words.\r\n* An API that is fluent and discoverable nearly entirely through IDE auto-completion.\r\n\r\n```\r\npublic class StackSpec {{\r\n\r\n    Stack<Integer> stack = new Stack<>();\r\n\r\n    describe(\"a stack\", it -> {\r\n\r\n        it.shouldSetup(stack::clear);\r\n\r\n        it.shouldTearDown(stack::clear);\r\n\r\n        it.should(\"be empty when created\", expect -> {\r\n            expect.that(stack).isEmpty();\r\n        });\r\n```\r\n\r\nEvery specification suite starts its declared using the `Suite.describe` method. From that point onwards your IDE should be able to auto-complete the domain specific language for declaring specifications, but just in case you want more information, here's the details.\r\n\r\n* If you want to specify a property about your system use `it.should`.\r\n* If you want describe an expectation of that property, use `expect.that`. This will get you to a fluent API restricted to the type of value that you're making the expectation about. The expectation system is based upon hamcrest. Lambda Behave doesn't compromised the ability to compose matchers in favour of fluency - if you want to compose in more complex flavours simply use `expect.that(value).is()` and then you can use regular Hamcrest matchers. In my experience this is a rare, albeit useful, breakout option.\r\n* If you want to setup or teardown data before or after each specification use `it.shouldSetup` and `it.shouldTearDown`.\r\n* If you want to setup or teardown data before or after each suite use `it.shouldInitialize` and `it.shouldComplete`.\r\n* Don't worry - I know some Java 8 lambdafied APIs don't deal with exceptions very well but you can throw exceptions in all our callbacks and then will cause the appropriate error to be reported, not just break the library.\r\n\r\n### Data Driven Specifications\r\n\r\nThe ability to parametrise specifications by different data inputs.  Data driven tests in TestNG or the `@Parameterized` junit annotation perform a similar task. `@Parameterized` only parameterises at the level of a class, whereas Lambda Behave parameterises at the level of a specification. The API in Lambda Behave is both fluent and also type safe and doesn't rely on reflection magic.\r\n\r\n```\r\n    describe(\"a pair of numbers\", it -> {\r\n        it.uses(2, 4)\r\n          .and(4, 8)\r\n          .toShow(\"%d / %d is two\", (expect, x, y) -> {\r\n              expect.that(y / x).is(2);\r\n          });\r\n    });\r\n```\r\n\r\nNot only is the specification parameterised by the data, but the description is also parameterised, its name being interpreted as a format `String`. The aforementioned test would output the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\na pair of numbers\r\n  2 / 4 is two\r\n  4 / 8 is two\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Using Lambda Behave\r\n\r\nIf you're using a maven project then you can download Lambda Behave using the following pom entry.\r\n\r\n```\r\n<dependency>\r\n    <groupId>com.insightfullogic</groupId>\r\n    <artifactId>lambda-behave</artifactId>\r\n    <version>0.1</version>\r\n    <scope>test</scope>\r\n</dependency>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Junit Integration\r\n\r\nLambda behave also offers a junit runner. This lets you easily integrate into existing your existing test suite, or the tests via an Eclipse, Intellij, Netbeans, Maven, Gradle or Ant. You can use annotations to drive this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@RunWith(JunitSuiteRunner.class)\r\npublic class StackSpec {{\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Lambdas - what the hell are they?\r\n\r\nConveniently I've written a [book](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920030713.do?cmp=af-prog-books-videos-product_cj_9781491900154_%25zp') on Lambda expressions in Java 8 and the cleaner code they enable!\r\n\r\n### How to contribute\r\n\r\nPatches should be submitted as github pull requests, issues filed via the github.\r\n\r\nHave fun!","google":"UA-25501442-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
